"Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: 'I will create a vicegerent (man) on earth.'
They said: 'Wilt Thou place therein, one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?'
He said: 'I know what ye know not.'
And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the angels, and said: 'Tell me the names of these if ye are right.'
They said: 'Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom.'
He said: 'O Adam! Tell them their names.'
When he had told them, Allah said: 'Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?'"
